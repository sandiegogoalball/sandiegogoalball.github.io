# San Diego Goalball Website

This is the official website for San Diego County Goalball, a community dedicated to providing athletic opportunities for the blind and visually impaired.

## Architecture

The website is built as a multi-page static site for maximum performance, accessibility, and reliability. It uses:
- **HTML5**: For semantic structure.
- **Tailwind CSS (CDN)**: For styling without a build step.
- **Inter Font**: For clear, modern typography.

## Pages

- `index.html`: Home page
- `about.html`: About the organization and mission.
- `programs.html`: Information about the sport of Goalball.
- `schedule.html`: Practice times and locations.
- `get-involved.html`: Volunteering and support information.
- `contact.html`: Contact information and message form.

## Maintenance

To make changes to the site:
1. Edit the relevant `.html` file.
2. If changing the header or footer, remember to update all files to maintain consistency.
3. Assets are located in the `/images` directory.

## Deployment

The site is designed to be hosted on GitHub Pages using the "Classic" experience (deploying directly from a branch). No build process is required.
